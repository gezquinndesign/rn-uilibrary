Originally forked from https://github.com/ugglr/react-native-storybook-boilerplate. Adapted to create a design system that is published as a component library and used by https://github.com/gezquinndesign/rn-monorepo.

This repo and the monorepo are designed to be used together to develop a React Native Web project that works on mobile as well as web.
