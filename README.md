# React Native Web UI Library

Originally forked from [react-native-storybook-boilerplate](https://github.com/ugglr/react-native-storybook-boilerplate). Adapted to create a design system that is published as a component library and used by [rn-monorepo](https://github.com/gezquinndesign/rn-monorepo).

This repo and the Monorepo are designed to be used together to develop a React Native Web project that works on mobile as well as web.
